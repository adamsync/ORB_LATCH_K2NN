# ORB_LATCH_K2NN

## About 

Implementation of komrad36's LATCH and K2NN libraries from komrad36, based on ORB descriptors from OpenCV's features2d

- https://github.com/komrad36/LATCH
- https://github.com/komrad36/K2NN

## Usage

`ORB_LATCH_K2NN /path/to/images` , this will build two datafiles, one with all 
the keypoints*descriptors, and another with just the first image to use as a search/query with K2NN
  
### Todo

- Use CUDA libraries once basics are working
